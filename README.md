# Bitstream
![bitstream-release](https://github.com/michal-hubert/bitstream/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)


C++ class (header only) allowing to put/get individual bits instead of whole bytes.
Can be useful as a data layer if size matters. In some cases (e.g. putting individual bits)
the amount of spared space can be large.
